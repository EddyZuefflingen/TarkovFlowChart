# TarkovFlowChart

This program shows all quests, how they are linked and whether the player or another friend has completed them.

An API key from “https://tarkovtracker.io/” is required to use this program.
If no friend is available, then simply enter this there too.

The information must be entered in the following file:
src\environment\environment_example.ts

Then rename the file to “environment.ts”
